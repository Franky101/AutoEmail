Why Im Doing this?
No particular reason, I have been working in Change Management where a lot of minor tasks are done daily and something as simple as an email can take around 2 to 10 minutes or 25 minutes depending the internet and complexity. With time I became more and more interested in automating tasks and find way to share this knowledge so everyone speak the same lenguage or make it so easy that it would be crazy not to do the same.

So far I have tried several toosl and methods like: Python, RPA, Scripting, AHK. Each one with something good and something bad that took it off the list b


The idea is to find the best and easiest way possible to automate some tasks related to Office work such as:

- Sending a report in certain time
- Setting some alerts and reminders comming up while you are working
- Reminders about meetings in the way you want
- Updating existing reports or excel files online and offline
- Creating new reports and data analysis from existing reports that get updated daily
- Organizing Files in your computer
- Cleaning up your email inbox and folders
- Bringing up needed documentation that is in the deeps of Sharepoint/Drive/Git/Hell/One note

This being developed, the final stage of this project or final round per iteration will be about how to share this information with co-workers and make sure everyone has the same updated information from this automated scripts in Python, Power Shell, Dark magic or wathever.

Since this is not RPA because of many issues while trying to implement. version will be needed.


### Why
> Eveyrone time is limited and we give a lot of it to simple tasks that doesn't add any value but are needed. If you want more time, make less mistakes and worry less, This is your app. Automate your daily tasks with this app, not much time needed, not programming skills needed.

### Vision
> Be the easiest app there is to make office task easier in the world.
### Mission
> App that save time and add value in a simple, short manner. Automate is what we do, you do you.
